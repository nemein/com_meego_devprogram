== Overview ==

This web application [DevProgram from now] aims to bridge a gap between vendors
who would like to promote their harware platforms and developers who are willing
to get started with new development environments.

Using DevProgram developers can easily see the offers from MeeGo vendors and
apply to those that interest them.

== Target Audience ==

DevProgram targets every subscribed user of meego.com and does not
differentiate among them. Only the administrational tasks are hidden and
available only to nominated administrators.

See the next chapter on certain roles.

== What does DevProgram do? ==

DevProgram is a match making service. Users of DevProgram can act as vendors or
developers at the same time. Let's see what these different roles mean.

* A developer can browse all the available device programs from various vendors.

* A developer can apply for any program by submitting a project idea.

* The developer will receive email notification about the outcome of the
applications, but can also check that through the web interface.

* A vendor can initiate developer device programs. Within the terms of a program
the vendor offers a certain amount of devices, development boards, or any other
hardware that can run MeeGo.

* The vendor can track applicants and can approve or deny applications.

* The vendor manages the available stocks using the web interface.

== What we are not aiming at ==

DevProgram does not store personal information and does not act as a broker
of such information between developers and vendors. If an application is
approved by a vendor, then the communication between the developer and vendor
continues through other means (email, fax, phone etc) to get details of shipment
, payment (if any) etc.
